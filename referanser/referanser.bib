  abstract      = {
    The two most commonly used methods to analyze data from real-time,
    quantitative PCR experiments are absolute quantification and relative
    quantification. Absolute quantification determines the input copy number,
    usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative
    quantification relates the PCR signal of the target transcript in a treatment
    group to that of another sample such as an untreated control. The 2−ΔΔCT
    method is a convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene expression
    from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The purpose of this report is to
    present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the 2−ΔΔCT method.
    In addition, we present the derivation and applications of two variations of
    the 2−ΔΔCT method that may be useful in the analysis of real-time,
    quantitative PCR data.
